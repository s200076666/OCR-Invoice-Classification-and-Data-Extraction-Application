# OCR-Invoice-Classification-and-Data-Extraction-Application
This project is a desktop application built with TensorFlow and Tkinter. It uses a MobileNetV2 model to classify images as invoices or non-invoices. For invoices, it extracts specific data using OCR (Tesseract) and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can upload files, view predictions, and save or generate PDFs with the extracted data.
Key components include:
TensorFlow: For training and using the image classification model.
Tesseract OCR: For extracting text from images and PDFs.
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.
PyMuPDF: For handling PDF text extraction.
FPDF: For creating PDF documents with extracted data.
